    <string name="hello">Netology. University of Internet Professions!</string>
    <string name="text">Hi, this is a new Netology! Once upon a time, Netology
began with intensive courses in online marketing. Then
there were courses in design, development, analytics
and management. We grow ourselves and help
students grow: from beginners to confident professionals.
But the most important thing remains with us: we believe that
everyone already has the power that makes them want
more, aim higher, run faster. Our mission
- help to embark on the path of growth and start a chain
of changes - http: //netology.gy/fyb</string>
